# Batch 5 Implementation Summary: URL Handling and Specialized Features

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Utility Initialization
- Updated `bootstrap.lua` to properly initialize utility modules
- Added error handling and proper sequencing of initialization steps
- Ensured utilities are loaded before plugin setup is complete

### 2. Buffer Management Features
- Added `close_other_buffers()` to close all buffers except the current one
- Added `close_unused_buffers(minutes)` to close buffers inactive for a specified time
- Added `save_all_buffers()` to save all modified buffers
- Added `jump_to_alternate()` for smart buffer switching
- Added corresponding user commands:
  - `BufCloseOthers`
  - `BufCloseUnused [minutes]`
  - `BufSaveAll`

### 3. Miscellaneous Utilities
- Added `toggle_line_numbers()` to switch between relative and absolute line numbers
- Added `trim_whitespace()` to remove trailing whitespace
- Added `random_string(length)` for generating random strings
- Added visual selection information features:
  - `get_visual_selection_info()` - Calculate selection metrics
  - `show_selection_info()` - Display selection statistics
- Added corresponding user commands:
  - `ToggleLineNumbers`
  - `TrimWhitespace`
  - `SelectionInfo`

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Maintained global function aliases for backward compatibility
- Ensured all new functionality is also accessible via the module API
- Added error handling to all utility functions

## Testing Notes
To test these new features, you can:

1. Try the new buffer management commands:
   ```
   :BufCloseOthers
   :BufCloseUnused 10
   :BufSaveAll
   ```

2. Use the miscellaneous utilities:
   ```
   :ToggleLineNumbers
   :TrimWhitespace
   ```

3. Select some text in visual mode and run:
   ```
   :SelectionInfo
   ```

4. Test URL features (already implemented and now properly initialized):
   - Use `gx` on a URL
   - Try Ctrl+Click on a URL
   - Select URLs in markdown links

## Next Steps
1. Proceed to Batch 6: Cleanup and Documentation
2. Work on removing `.bak` and `.old` files
3. Consider adding documentation for the utility modules
4. Clean up any remaining TODO items from the refactoring plan
