# Drafts Type Safety Fix

## Issue
When opening the Drafts folder in the sidebar, the following error occurred:
```
stack traceback: ...nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/tools/himalaya/ui/sidebar_v2.lua:106: in function 'format_email_list'
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The `sidebar_v2.lua` module was attempting to call `:match()` on `email.from` without checking its type. The `email.from` field can be:
1. A string (e.g., "user@example.com" or "Name <user@example.com>")
2. A table with `name` and `addr` fields (e.g., `{name = "John Doe", addr = "john@example.com"}`)
3. `nil` or other types

## Solution
Added comprehensive type checking in `sidebar_v2.lua` to handle all possible types of the `email.from` field:

```lua
-- Parse from field (it can be a table, string, or other type)
local from = ''
if email.from then
  if type(email.from) == 'table' then
    from = email.from.name or email.from.addr or ''
  elseif type(email.from) == 'string' then
    from = email.from
    -- Extract email from "Name <email@example.com>" format
    if from:match('<(.+)>') then
      from = from:match('<(.+)>')
    end
  else
    from = tostring(email.from)
  end
end
```

## Design Principles Applied
1. **Defensive Programming**: Always check types before calling methods
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle unexpected types by converting to string
3. **Consistent Handling**: Apply the same type safety pattern across all email field accesses

## Testing
Created `test_drafts_type_safety.lua` to verify:
- All possible `email.from` types are handled correctly
- No runtime errors occur with edge cases
- Formatting remains consistent across different data types

## Related Fixes
The main `email_list.lua` module already had proper type safety for email fields, which served as the pattern for this fix.

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues:
1. Always validate external data types before operations
2. Use consistent patterns for handling email object fields
3. Consider creating helper functions for common field extractions
4. Add type annotations or documentation for expected data structures
