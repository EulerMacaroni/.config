# Draft System Migration Complete

## Migration Summary

The Himalaya draft system has been successfully migrated from the dual JSON/EML format to pure Maildir format.

### What Changed

1. **Storage Format**: 
   - Before: JSON metadata + EML files in `~/.local/share/nvim/himalaya/drafts/`
   - After: Standard Maildir format in `~/Mail/AccountName/.Drafts/`

2. **Synchronization**:
   - Before: Custom sync via `himalaya template save`
   - After: Standard mbsync handles all synchronization

3. **Code Reduction**:
   - Deleted 6 modules (~931 lines)
   - Simplified 4 core modules
   - Total reduction: ~40% of draft-related code

### Deleted Modules

- `core/local_storage.lua` - JSON/EML storage system
- `core/draft_cleanup.lua` - Draft cleanup utilities
- `core/draft_migration.lua` - Old migration tools
- `core/draft_nuclear.lua` - Emergency cleanup
- `core/draft_account_fix.lua` - Account workarounds
- `core/health/draft.lua` - Draft-specific health checks

### New Modules

- `core/maildir.lua` - Minimal Maildir operations
- `core/draft_manager_maildir.lua` - Simplified draft management
- `ui/email_composer_maildir.lua` - Clean email composition
- `migrations/draft_to_maildir.lua` - Migration tool

### Migration Path

For users with existing drafts:

```vim
" Preview what will be migrated
:HimalayaMigrateDraftsToMaildir preview

" Run migration
:HimalayaMigrateDraftsToMaildir

" Verify migration
:HimalayaDraftMigrationVerify
```

### Documentation

- See [MAILDIR_DRAFT_SYSTEM.md](MAILDIR_DRAFT_SYSTEM.md) for the new system documentation
- See [DRAFTS_MAILDIR.md](DRAFTS_MAILDIR.md) for the implementation plan

### Key Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: One format for all emails
2. **Reliability**: Atomic Maildir operations
3. **Performance**: No JSON parsing overhead
4. **Compatibility**: Works with any Maildir-compatible tool
5. **Maintainability**: Significantly less code to maintain

### For Developers

The migration followed a phase-based approach:

1. Phase 1: Created Maildir module and migration tool
2. Phase 2: Updated draft_manager to use Maildir
3. Phase 3: Updated email_composer for Maildir
4. Phase 4: Cleaned up UI components
5. Phase 5: Deleted redundant modules
6. Phase 6: Final integration and testing

All functionality has been preserved while significantly reducing complexity.

### Testing

Run comprehensive tests to verify the migration:

```vim
:HimalayaTestMaildirIntegration
```

This runs all test suites and provides a detailed report.

## Conclusion

The Maildir migration successfully eliminates technical debt while improving performance and reliability. The draft system is now simpler, faster, and more maintainable.
