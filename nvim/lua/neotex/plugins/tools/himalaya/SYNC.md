# Gmail IMAP Sync Diagnostics and Fix Plan

## Problem Summary
Gmail account is missing the Trash folder from Himalaya's folder list, causing "No trash folder found" errors during delete operations. Research indicates this is likely due to Gmail IMAP settings or mbsync configuration issues.

## Research Findings

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Gmail IMAP "Show in IMAP" Settings**: Gmail has specific checkboxes for each system folder that control IMAP visibility
2. **mbsync Configuration Issues**: `.mbsyncrc` might be excluding Gmail folders or missing proper `[Gmail]/Trash` mapping  
3. **Gmail's Non-Standard IMAP**: Gmail uses labels instead of folders, causing visibility issues with email clients

### Common Solutions from Research
- Enable "Trash: Show in IMAP" in Gmail web settings
- Configure proper channel mapping for `[Gmail]/Trash` in mbsync
- Adjust Gmail's "When I mark a message in IMAP as deleted" settings

## Diagnostic and Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnose Gmail IMAP Settings
- [ ] Create command to guide user through Gmail web interface settings verification
- [ ] Check that "Show in IMAP" is enabled for Trash folder in Gmail ÔøΩ Settings ÔøΩ Labels ÔøΩ System labels
- [ ] Verify Gmail ÔøΩ Settings ÔøΩ Forwarding and POP/IMAP ÔøΩ Delete behavior settings

### Phase 2: Examine mbsync Configuration  
- [ ] Read and analyze user's `.mbsyncrc` file
- [ ] Check for Gmail folder patterns and exclusions
- [ ] Verify `[Gmail]/Trash` channel configuration exists
- [ ] Look for potential conflicts (Path + SubFolders Maildir++)

### Phase 3: Test Current Folder Detection
- [ ] Run Himalaya folder list command directly
- [ ] Compare available folders with expected Gmail IMAP folders
- [ ] Test raw IMAP connection to see what Gmail exposes

### Phase 4: Fix Configuration Issues
- [ ] Update `.mbsyncrc` with proper Gmail trash folder mapping if missing
- [ ] Add explicit channel for `[Gmail]/Trash` 
- [ ] Ensure proper quoting and syntax for folder names with spaces/special chars
- [ ] Test configuration changes

### Phase 5: Alternative Solutions
- [ ] If trash folder remains unavailable, implement custom folder workaround
- [ ] Configure to use All Mail as deletion target (Gmail's archive behavior)
- [ ] Update Himalaya delete logic to handle Gmail's label-based system

## Diagnostic Results

### üîç Root Cause Identified
**CONFIRMED**: Gmail Trash folder missing due to mbsync configuration issue.

**Current .mbsyncrc Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ Has Gmail IMAP store configured properly (XOAUTH2)
- ‚úÖ Has Gmail local maildir store 
- ‚úÖ Has single "gmail" channel with `Patterns *`
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: No specific channel for `[Gmail]/Trash` folder
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses `Patterns *` which should sync all folders, but Trash is still missing

**Current Folder Status:**
- Available: [Gmail].Sent Mail, [Gmail].All Mail, [Gmail].Drafts + custom folders
- Missing: [Gmail]/Trash, [Gmail]/Spam
- Himalaya sees: 6 folders total, 3 Gmail system folders

### üéØ Specific Issue
Your mbsync config uses `Patterns *` which should sync all Gmail folders, but Gmail's IMAP is not exposing the Trash folder. This suggests:

1. **Gmail IMAP Setting**: "Show in IMAP" for Trash may be disabled
2. **Gmail Account Setup**: Your Gmail might have non-standard folder configuration

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Primary Goal**: ~~Restore `[Gmail]/Trash` folder visibility in Himalaya~~ ‚Üí **NEW: Implement local trash directory**
2. **Secondary Goal**: Proper delete operations that move emails to local trash with recovery options
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Full trash management system with UI browser and cleanup automation

## Phase 6: Local Trash Directory Implementation

### üóÇÔ∏è USER DECISION: Local Trash Instead of Gmail IMAP Trash

**User preference**: Create local trash directory instead of enabling Gmail IMAP trash folder.

### Benefits of Local Trash Approach
1. **Independent of Gmail settings** - No need to modify Gmail IMAP configuration
2. **Full control** - Complete ownership of deleted emails
3. **Faster operations** - No network dependency for delete operations
4. **Email recovery** - Easy access to deleted emails for salvage
5. **Consistent behavior** - Same trash behavior regardless of email provider

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Design folder structure for organized trash storage
- [ ] Implement date-based organization (e.g., `YYYY/MM/DD/` subdirectories)
- [ ] Add metadata tracking (original folder, deletion date, email ID)

#### Phase 6.2: Enhanced Delete Operation
- [ ] Modify delete operation to move emails to local trash instead of IMAP trash
- [ ] Preserve original email structure and headers
- [ ] Store deletion metadata (JSON sidecar files or database)
- [ ] Implement atomic move operations to prevent data loss
- [ ] Add progress indicators for large email moves

#### Phase 6.3: Trash Management System

- [ ] Add email restoration functionality (move back to original folder)
- [ ] Implement permanent deletion (remove from local trash)
- [ ] Add trash cleanup (auto-delete old emails after X days)

#### Phase 6.4: Configuration Options
- [ ] Add trash directory configuration option
- [ ] Configure retention policy (default: 30 days)
- [ ] Add trash size limits and cleanup policies
- [ ] Option to disable/enable local trash vs IMAP trash
- [ ] Backup/export options for trash contents

#### Phase 6.5: UI Integration
- [ ] Add trash folder to folder list (special handling)
- [ ] Implement trash-specific operations (restore, permanent delete)
- [ ] Add trash status indicators (item count, disk usage)
- [ ] Create trash management commands and keymaps
- [ ] Integrate with existing sidebar and navigation
