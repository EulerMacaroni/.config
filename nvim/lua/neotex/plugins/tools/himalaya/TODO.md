# Himalaya TODO

> PROMPT: Use this document to create a detailed REFACTOR_SPEC.md and FEATURES_SPEC.md

## PLAN

- [ ] document existing implementation
  - [ ] create refactor spec in /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/tools/himalaya/spec/REFACTOR_SPEC.md
  - [ ] implement refactor
- [ ] add new features to himalaya
  - [ ] create new features spec in /home/benjamin/.config/nvim/lua/neotex/plugins/tools/himalaya/spec/FEATURES_SPEC.md
  - [ ] implement new features
- [ ] update documentation

## GUIDELINES

- no need for backwards compatibility or comments about past implementations
- keep the number of modules and commands minimal
  - better to work with and change the existing modules than creating new
  - it is OK to create new modules and commands if there is good reason
- integrate with existing neovim configuration
  - use the notification system described in `nvim/docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md`
- track progress
  - work in phases
  - test changes once complete by running commands and then asking me to test the feature
  - commit changes once testing for a phase is complete
  - keep this TODO.md and the spec files updated as phases are completed, tested, and committed
  - update documentation after all phases are completed and fully tested
