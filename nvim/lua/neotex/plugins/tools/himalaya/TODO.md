## GUIDELINES

- no need for backwards compatibility or comments about past implementations
- keep the number of modules and commands minimal
  - better to work with and change the existing modules than creating new
  - it is OK to create new modules and commands if there is good reason
- integrate with existing neovim configuration
  - use the notification system described in `nvim/docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md`
  - preserve all existing functionality
- track progress
  - work in phases
  - test changes once complete by running commands and then asking me to test the feature
  - commit changes once testing for a phase is complete
  - keep this TODO.md and the spec files updated as phases are completed, tested, and committed
  - update documentation after all phases are completed and fully tested

## DETAILS
