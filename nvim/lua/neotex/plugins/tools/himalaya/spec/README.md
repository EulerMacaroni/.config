  - ‚úÖ UI layout refactoring
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced UI/UX features
  - ‚úÖ Unified state management
  - ‚úÖ Centralized notification system
  - ‚úÖ Email preview in sidebar

### Phase Overview

The implementation is organized into 10 phases, with phases 6-10 representing the future work:

```
Phase 1-5: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Current State)
Phase 6:   üîÑ Event System Foundation (1 week)
Phase 7:   üìã Command Refactoring (1 week)
Phase 8:   üöÄ Service Layer & Features (2 weeks)
Phase 9:   üé® UI Evolution (2 weeks)
Phase 10:  ‚ú® Integration & Polish (1 week)
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Where to Begin

1. **Review Current State**
   - Read [ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_SPEC.md](ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_SPEC.md) sections on "Current State Assessment"
   - Understand the existing architecture and completed work

2. **Understand Technical Debt**
   - Review [TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md) for priority items
   - Focus on Priority 1 items that block new features

3. **Start with Phase 6: Event System**
   - Begin with the event system foundation (see Architecture spec)
   - This enables all future improvements without breaking existing code

### Implementation Order

#### Week 1: Foundation
Start with Phase 6 from [ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_SPEC.md](ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_SPEC.md):
- Implement event bus system
- Define core events
- Add events alongside existing calls (no breaking changes)

#### Week 2: Command Refactoring
Phase 7 tasks from multiple specs:
- Split `commands.lua` as outlined in [CLEANUP_AND_REFINEMENT_SPEC.md](CLEANUP_AND_REFINEMENT_SPEC.md)
- Implement command orchestration layer
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### Week 3-4: Core Features
Implement high-priority features from [EMAIL_MANAGEMENT_FEATURES_SPEC.md](EMAIL_MANAGEMENT_FEATURES_SPEC.md):
- Multiple account support (critical for many features)
- Attachment handling
- OAuth security improvements
- Address autocomplete

#### Week 5-6: Advanced Features
Select features from [ADVANCED_FEATURES_SPEC.md](ADVANCED_FEATURES_SPEC.md) based on user demand:
- Undo send system (high user value)
- Advanced search
- Email templates
- Basic scheduling

#### Week 7: Polish & Integration
Final integration from all specs:
- Performance optimizations from [CODE_QUALITY_AND_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE_SPEC.md](CODE_QUALITY_AND_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE_SPEC.md)
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Principles
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All improvements must maintain backward compatibility
2. **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested changes over big rewrites
3. **User First**: Features that provide immediate user value take priority
4. **Event-Driven**: New features should use the event system
5. **Well-Tested**: Each feature needs appropriate test coverage

### Working with Specs
1. Each spec is self-contained with implementation details
2. Cross-reference specs when features overlap
3. Update specs as implementation reveals new insights
4. Create GitHub issues from spec sections for tracking

### Code Organization
```
himalaya/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestration/   # New: Event system and coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Enhanced: Split commands, better errors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service/        # New: Feature services (accounts, search, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Enhanced: Controllers, new components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/          # New: Testing infrastructure
```

## üìä Success Metrics

Track progress using these metrics:
- All 31+ existing commands continue working
- 15-20% reduction in code complexity
- 80%+ test coverage on new code
- < 100ms response time for common operations
- Zero breaking changes for users
