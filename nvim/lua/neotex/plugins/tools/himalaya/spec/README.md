# Specification Documents

Planning, refactoring, and feature specification documents for systematic Himalaya plugin development and improvement.

## Purpose

These specifications provide structured guidance for plugin development:
- **Systematic planning** - Phased approach to complex changes
- **Progress tracking** - Clear milestones and completion criteria
- **Risk management** - Rollback strategies and testing requirements
- **Future roadmap** - Organized feature development pipeline

## Documents

### SAFE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md
Comprehensive refactoring plan with safety-first approach:
- **Phase-by-phase implementation** - 7 distinct phases with testing checkpoints
- **Architecture improvements** - Clean module hierarchy and state unification
- **Testing protocols** - Comprehensive validation after each phase
- **Rollback strategies** - Recovery procedures for failed refactoring steps
- **Success criteria** - Clear metrics for completion

**Status**: Phases 1-5 complete [x], Phases 6-7 pending (testing and validation)

Key accomplishments:
- Modularized UI components (email_list, email_viewer, email_composer)
- Unified state management system
- Standardized notification system
- Clean architecture with defined layer dependencies

<!-- TODO: Add automated testing suite for Phase 6 -->
<!-- TODO: Implement performance benchmarking for Phase 7 -->

### FEATURES_SPEC.md
Future features specification for post-refactor development:
- **High Priority Features** - Enhanced UI/UX, email management, sync improvements
- **Medium Priority Features** - Code quality, developer experience, performance
- **Low Priority Features** - Advanced features and integrations
- **Implementation guidance** - Architecture compatibility and best practices

**Status**: Specification complete [x], implementation pending

Priority feature categories:
- Enhanced UI/UX (hover preview, buffer composition, improved confirmations)
- Email Management (attachments, images, custom headers, local trash)
- Sync Improvements (smart status, auto-sync, error recovery)

<!-- TODO: Create detailed implementation specs for high-priority features -->
<!-- TODO: Add user research for UI/UX improvements -->

## Development Workflow

The specification documents support this development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase** - Create detailed specifications
2. **Implementation Phase** - Follow phased approach with testing
3. **Validation Phase** - Comprehensive testing and user feedback
4. **Documentation Phase** - Update specs with lessons learned

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Review SAFE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md before making architectural changes
- Check FEATURES_SPEC.md before implementing new features
- Update specifications when implementation differs from plan
- Follow testing protocols for all changes

### For Project Management
- Use specifications for milestone planning
- Track progress against documented phases
- Review completion criteria before marking phases complete
- Update project status in TODO.md
