## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Principles
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All improvements must maintain backward compatibility
2. **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested changes over big rewrites
3. **User First**: Features that provide immediate user value take priority
4. **Event-Driven**: New features should use the event system
5. **Well-Tested**: Each feature needs appropriate test coverage

### Working with Specs
1. Each spec is self-contained with implementation details
2. Cross-reference specs when features overlap
3. Update specs as implementation reveals new insights
4. Create GitHub issues from spec sections for tracking

### Code Organization
```
himalaya/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestration/   # New: Event system and coordination
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Enhanced: Split commands, better errors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service/        # New: Feature services (accounts, search, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Enhanced: Controllers, new components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/          # New: Testing infrastructure
```
