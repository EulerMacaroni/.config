# Himalaya Draft Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Draft Issues

### 1. Draft ID Tracking and Duplicate Prevention
- Added `draft_id_to_buffer` mapping to track which buffer owns which draft ID
- Modified `sync_draft_to_maildir` to accept existing draft ID parameter
- Updated auto-save logic to update existing drafts instead of creating new ones
- Added validation to match drafts by subject when finding draft IDs

### 2. Draft Subject Display in Sidebar
- Enhanced draft ID matching in `utils.save_draft` to find drafts by subject match
- Added explicit caching of draft data after save with subject information
- Clear cache before storing to prevent stale data
- Added debug logging to track subject storage and retrieval

### 3. Draft Deletion After Sending
- Enhanced scheduler to show draft ID when deleting
- Added notifications to track draft cleanup process
- Improved metadata passing from composer to scheduler
- Added validation to prevent invalid draft IDs from being deleted

### 4. Key Functions Modified

#### email_composer.lua
- Added draft ID tracking with `draft_id_to_buffer` map
- Modified `sync_draft_to_maildir` to accept existing draft ID
- Updated auto-save to prevent duplicate draft creation
- Added cleanup of draft ID tracking on buffer unload
- Enhanced draft reopening to mark drafts as already synced

#### utils.lua
- Enhanced `save_draft` to match drafts by subject
- Added better logging for draft ID discovery
- Improved validation to prevent folder names as IDs

#### scheduler.lua
- Added notifications for draft deletion process
- Enhanced logging for draft cleanup debugging

#### email_cache.lua
- Clear cache before storing to prevent stale data

## Remaining Issues to Monitor

1. **Draft Subject Display**: The sidebar should now show draft subjects correctly. Monitor if subjects appear after creating/saving drafts.

2. **Draft Deletion**: Drafts should be deleted after emails are sent. Check the notifications to see if draft IDs are being passed correctly.

3. **Duplicate Drafts**: The new tracking system should prevent duplicate drafts. Verify that opening and saving drafts doesn't create new copies.

## Debug Commands

To help debug remaining issues:

1. Check draft IDs: Look for notifications like "Draft saved with ID: X, Subject: Y"
2. Monitor sending: Look for "Sending email with draft ID: X"
3. Track deletion: Look for "Deleting draft ID: X after send"

## Next Steps

Test the following workflow:
1. Create a new draft with subject
2. Save it and check if subject appears in sidebar
3. Close and reopen the draft
4. Make changes and save again - verify no duplicate is created
5. Send the draft - verify it gets deleted after sending
