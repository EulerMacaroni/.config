# Enhanced UI/UX Features Implementation Specification

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

Most features have been implemented with some deviations from the original specification.

## Overview

This specification documents the implementation of enhanced UI/UX features in the Himalaya email plugin. These features focused on improving user interaction, providing better visual feedback, and modernizing the email experience.

**Final Implementation Status**: 
- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation - Complete
- ✅ Phase 2: Hover Preview - Complete 
- ✅ Phase 3: Buffer-based Composition - Complete
- ⚠️ Phase 4: Improved Confirmations - Partially Complete (using standard vim.ui.select)
- ✅ Phase 5: Accurate Email Count - Complete
- ❌ Phase 6: Buffer-based Email Viewing - Not Implemented (removed in favor of preview window)

## Feature Implementation Summary

### 1. **Hover Preview** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Location**: `ui/email_preview.lua`

**What was implemented**:
- Preview window that appears to the right of the sidebar
- Keyboard hover detection with 100ms debounce
- Mouse hover detection with 1000ms debounce  
- Preview mode toggling with Enter (enter preview) and Esc (exit preview)
- Full email content loading with async support
- Mouse click handling to navigate between sidebar and preview
- Action keymaps in preview: gr (reply), gR (reply all), gf (forward), gD (delete), gA (archive), gS (star)
- Buffer pooling for performance
- Email cache integration for instant previews
- Smart positioning and sizing

**Deviations from spec**:
- More sophisticated than originally planned with full preview mode
- Added mouse support not in original spec
- Tighter integration with sidebar navigation

### 2. **Buffer-based Composition** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Location**: `ui/email_composer.lua` (merged v2 functionality into main file)

**What was implemented**:
- Regular buffers for email composition with temp file backing
- Auto-save every 30 seconds to local draft file
- Draft syncing to maildir Drafts folder
- Email syntax highlighting (headers, quoted text)
- Tab navigation between header fields
- Proper draft cleanup on send/discard
- Opens in current window by default (not tab as originally specified)
- Full integration with spell checking
- Restore draft functionality

**Deviations from spec**:
- Opens in current window instead of tab by default
- No separate v2 module - functionality merged into main composer
- More robust draft management than originally planned

### 3. **Buffer-based Email Viewing** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Reason**: After implementing the preview window system, buffer-based viewing was deemed redundant. The preview window provides a better integrated experience for reading emails while maintaining context in the sidebar.

**Current approach**:
- Emails are viewed in the preview window (floating window)
- Preview window provides all necessary functionality
- Maintains consistency with sidebar navigation
- Better for workflow as sidebar remains visible

### 4. **Improved Confirmations** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was implemented**:
- Using `vim.ui.select` for folder/account selection
- Using `neotex.util.misc.confirm` for yes/no prompts
- Basic confirmation functionality works well

**What was not implemented**:
- Custom confirmation dialog module (`ui/confirm.lua` was removed)
- Visual centered dialogs with custom styling
- Enter/Escape navigation (relies on vim.ui.select behavior)

**Reason**: Decided to use Neovim's built-in UI functions for consistency with the rest of the configuration rather than creating custom UI components.

### 5. **Accurate Email Count** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Location**: Various files including `ui/email_list.lua`, `utils.lua`, `state.lua`

**What was implemented**:
- Removed hardcoded "200 emails" display
- Shows actual email counts from himalaya
- Binary search algorithm for efficient count retrieval
- Count caching in state module with timestamps
- Automatic count updates after sync
- Age indicator for stale counts (e.g., "2061 emails (5m ago)")
- Graceful fallback when count unknown

**Implementation details**:
- `utils.fetch_folder_count()` - Binary search to find exact count
- `state.set_folder_count()` - Stores count with timestamp
- Count updates trigger immediate UI refresh
- Shows "X+ emails" when paginating through unknown total

### 6. **Remove Noisy Messages** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**What was implemented**:
- Removed "Himalaya closed" notifications from `ui/email_list.lua` and `core/commands.lua`
- All debug/background notifications are now properly gated behind debug mode
- OAuth refresh notifications only show in debug mode
- Sync channel fallback notification only shows in debug mode
- Kept user-facing notifications like pagination boundaries and empty maildir warnings

**Debug mode gating applied to**:
- Email count debugging messages
- Sync status line debugging
- Sidebar refresh debugging
- OAuth token refresh notifications (automatic operations)
- Sync channel fallback messages
- All BACKGROUND category notifications

## Architecture Changes from Specification

### Module Consolidation
Instead of creating parallel v2 modules, functionality was integrated into existing modules:
- `email_composer_v2.lua` → merged into `email_composer.lua`
- `email_preview_v2.lua` → merged into `email_preview.lua`  
- `email_viewer_v2.lua` → not created (preview window sufficient)
- `confirm.lua` → removed (using vim.ui.select)

### Design Decisions

1. **Preview over Buffer Viewing**: The preview window system provides a better integrated experience than opening emails in separate buffers/tabs.

2. **Standard UI Components**: Using vim.ui.select instead of custom confirmations maintains consistency with Neovim's UI paradigms.

3. **Window Management**: Focused on making the sidebar + preview window combination work seamlessly rather than adding more window types.

## Remaining Tasks

All high priority tasks have been completed. The following are potential future enhancements:

### Medium Priority  
1. **Improve confirmation dialogs** - Could enhance vim.ui.select appearance with custom styling
2. **Preview window enhancements** - HTML rendering, inline images, attachment preview

### Low Priority
1. **Buffer-based email viewing** - Could be added as an alternative to preview window
2. **Animation effects** - Smooth transitions for preview appearance/disappearance
3. **Custom notification system** - Replace vim.notify with a more sophisticated notification UI

## Configuration

Current configuration options:

```lua
{
  -- Preview window settings
  preview = {
    enabled = true,
    position = 'right',
    width = 80,
    debounce_keyboard = 100,
    debounce_mouse = 1000,
  },
  
  -- Composition settings
  compose = {
    auto_save_interval = 30,  -- seconds
    use_tab = false,  -- open in current window
  },
  
  -- UI settings
  ui = {
    sidebar_width = 50,
    show_status_line = true,
  },
  
  -- Debug mode
  debug_mode = false,  -- hides routine notifications
}
```

## Conclusion

The Enhanced UI/UX implementation successfully modernized the Himalaya email plugin interface. While not all features were implemented exactly as specified, the core goals were achieved:

1. **Better Email Preview**: The preview window system exceeds the original hover preview concept
2. **Modern Composition**: Buffer-based composition with auto-save works excellently  
3. **Accurate Information**: Email counts are now accurate and efficiently retrieved
4. **Cleaner Interface**: Reduced notification noise (though more work remains)

The implementation took a pragmatic approach, leveraging Neovim's built-in capabilities where appropriate rather than creating custom UI components. The result is a more maintainable and integrated system that fits well with the overall Neovim configuration.
