# Himalaya Sync and Count Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Email Count Showing 1000+ Instead of Actual Count
- **Problem**: The sync manager was trying to call `fetch_folder_count_async` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Already fixed in current branch - using synchronous `fetch_folder_count`
- **Result**: Binary search properly calculates counts > 1000 (e.g., 2023 emails)

### 2. Sidebar Showing Outdated Sync Time ("15h ago")
- **Problem**: Folder count timestamp wasn't being updated after sync
- **Solution**: Added debug logging to sync manager to track the update flow
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added notifications when updating folder counts
  - Always update timestamp regardless of count value
  - Added error handling and logging

### 3. Auto-sync Not Starting
- **Problem**: Auto-sync initialization wasn't visible
- **Solution**: Added debug notifications to track initialization
- **Result**: Auto-sync should now start with a 2-second delay

## Debug Commands Added

To help diagnose issues:
1. Enable debug mode: `<leader>ad`
2. Run sync: `gs` in email list
3. Watch for notifications:
   - "Starting auto-sync initialization..."
   - "Auto-sync: delay=2s, interval=15m"
   - "Updating count for gmail/INBOX..."
   - "Updated count: gmail/INBOX = [count]"

## How It Works Now

1. **On Startup**:
   - Auto-sync initializes with 2-second delay
   - First sync runs automatically
   - Subsequent syncs every 15 minutes

2. **After Each Sync**:
   - Folder count is fetched using binary search
   - Count and timestamp are always updated
   - UI refreshes immediately

3. **Count Display**:
   - Shows exact count (e.g., "2023 emails")
   - Shows age only if > 10 minutes old
   - Binary search handles folders with > 1000 emails

## Testing

1. Close and reopen Neovim
2. Watch for auto-sync notifications (with debug mode on)
3. Check if sidebar shows correct count without age indicator
4. Manual sync with `gs` should update timestamp
