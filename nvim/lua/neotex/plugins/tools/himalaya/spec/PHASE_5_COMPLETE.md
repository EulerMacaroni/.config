# Phase 5: Testing and Polish - COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 5 of the Himalaya draft system refactor has been successfully completed. This phase focused on creating a robust testing framework, debugging tools, comprehensive documentation, and performance optimizations.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅

**File**: `scripts/features/test_draft_refactor.lua`

Created a comprehensive test suite with 18 tests covering:
- Draft Manager: Registration, lookups, content updates
- ID Validator: Valid/invalid ID detection, sanitization
- Draft Parser: Email parsing, display headers, multipart content, vim.NIL cleanup
- Draft Cache: Metadata caching, content caching, persistence
- Retry Handler: Success after failures, non-retryable errors, himalaya-specific retries
- Integration: End-to-end draft lifecycle
- Performance: Large email parsing

All tests pass successfully.

### 2. Debug Commands ✅

**File**: `core/debug_commands.lua`

Created comprehensive debugging tools:
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug` - Main debug menu
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug state` - Show draft manager state
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug cache` - Display cache contents
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug buffer` - Analyze current buffer
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug validate` - System integrity check
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug parser` - Test parser on buffer
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug clear` - Clear all state (with confirmation)
- `:HimalayaDraftDebug maildir` - Show maildir drafts
- `:HimalayaLogLevel <level>` - Dynamic log level control

### 3. Documentation ✅

**Files Created**:
- `docs/DRAFT_SYSTEM_WORKAROUNDS.md` - Detailed documentation of all workarounds
- `core/draft_system_README.md` - Architecture and usage guide

Documentation covers:
- All himalaya CLI limitations and workarounds
- Architecture overview
- Implementation details
- Debug command reference
- Future improvement roadmap

### 4. Performance Optimization ✅

**File**: `core/performance.lua`

Implemented performance monitoring and optimization:
- Timer functions for operation profiling
- Memoization helper for expensive operations
- Debounce utility (used for draft saving)
- Throttle utility for rate limiting
- TTL cache implementation
- Performance metrics tracking
- `:HimalayaPerformance` command for reports

**Optimizations Applied**:
- Debounced draft saving (1 second delay)
- Performance timing in draft parser
- Cache operation monitoring

## Key Achievements

1. **Robust Testing**: The test suite ensures all components work correctly and prevents regressions.

2. **Debugging Tools**: Comprehensive debug commands make troubleshooting issues much easier.

3. **Clear Documentation**: All workarounds are documented with explanations of why they're needed.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Can now identify and optimize slow operations.

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests
```vim
:HimalayaTest test_draft_refactor
```

### Debugging Draft Issues
```vim
:HimalayaDraftDebug state       " Check draft manager
:HimalayaDraftDebug cache       " Inspect cache
:HimalayaLogLevel debug         " Enable debug logging
```

### Performance Monitoring
```vim
:HimalayaPerformance            " Show performance report
:HimalayaPerformance reset      " Reset metrics
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. **New Files**:
   - `/scripts/features/test_draft_refactor.lua`
   - `/core/debug_commands.lua`
   - `/core/performance.lua`
   - `/docs/DRAFT_SYSTEM_WORKAROUNDS.md`
   - `/core/draft_system_README.md`

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `/init.lua` - Added debug and performance setup
   - `/core/logger.lua` - Added get_level() function
   - `/core/draft_parser.lua` - Added performance timing
   - `/core/draft_cache.lua` - Added performance monitoring
   - `/ui/email_composer.lua` - Added debounced saving

## Next Steps

The draft system refactor is now complete. The system is:
- ✅ Robust against himalaya CLI limitations
- ✅ Well-tested with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Easy to debug with built-in diagnostic tools
- ✅ Well-documented for future maintenance
- ✅ Performance-optimized with monitoring

The draft functionality should now work reliably with:
- Content preserved when reopening drafts
- Subjects showing correctly in sidebar
- Preview working for all drafts
- Drafts cleaned up after sending
- No more ID validation errors

## Testing the Complete System

To verify everything works:

1. Create a new draft:
   ```vim
   :Himalaya compose
   ```

2. Save and reopen:
   ```vim
   :w
   :q
   :Himalaya
   " Navigate to Drafts folder and open the draft
   ```

3. Check debug info:
   ```vim
   :HimalayaDraftDebug validate
   ```

4. Monitor performance:
   ```vim
   :HimalayaPerformance
   ```

The refactor is complete and ready for use!
