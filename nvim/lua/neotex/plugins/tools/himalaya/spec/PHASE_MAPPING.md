## Implementation Notes

1. **Dependencies**: Phase order is important - each phase builds on previous work
2. **Flexibility**: Some items can shift between adjacent phases if needed
3. **Parallel Work**: Within a phase, multiple items can be worked on concurrently
4. **Testing**: Each phase should include tests for new functionality
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All work must maintain backward compatibility
