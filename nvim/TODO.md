> Test my mcp tools: get react hooks from context7 and then search for "react 2025 news" with tavily


I'll help you test your MCP tools by retrieving React Hooks documentation from Context7 and searching for React 2025 news using Tavily. Let me dispatch an agent to handle this task.


╭─  dispatch_agent  succeeded
│   running tool
│   prompt: Please test the MCP tools by performing these two tasks:
│   
│   1. Use Context7 to get documentation about React Hooks
│   2. Use Tavily to search for "react 2025 news"
│   
│   For each tool:
│   - Report whether the tool is working
│   - Show the results received
│   - Note any errors or issues encountered
│   
╰─  Please format the results clearly and separately for each tool.


I apologize, but I notice that I don't have access to either the Context7 or Tavily tools in the provided function list. The available tools are:

1. ls (list files/directories)
2. grep (search in files)
3. glob (file pattern matching)
4. attempt_completion (present results)
5. str_replace_editor (file editing)

None of these tools provide the functionality to:
- Get documentation about React Hooks via Context7
- Search for "react 2025 news" via Tavily

Therefore, I cannot perform the requested test of these MCP tools. I would need access to:
1. Context7-related functions (like get-library-docs)
2. Tavily search functions

Would you like me to:
1. Test different tools that are actually available in the current environment?
2. Wait for you to provide access to the Context7 and Tavily tools?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.


<thinking>
Since I've determined that the requested tools are not available and communicated this finding, I can now present this result using attempt_completion. I don't need to confirm any previous tool uses since I haven't used any tools yet.
</thinking>


✓  Task Completed

Test Results for MCP Tools:

1. Context7 (Documentation for React Hooks)
Status: ❌ Not Available
- Tool is not accessible in the current environment
- Unable to retrieve React Hooks documentation
- Error: Context7 functions are not present in the available toolset

2. Tavily (Search for "react 2025 news")
Status: ❌ Not Available
- Tool is not accessible in the current environment
- Unable to perform the search query
- Error: Tavily search functions are not present in the available toolset

Summary:
Neither Context7 nor Tavily tools are available in the current environment. The available tools are limited to file system operations (ls, grep, glob) and file editing (str_replace_editor). To test these specific MCP tools, the environment would need to be updated to include the required Context7 and Tavily functions.
